\title{Running Gurobi LP solver}
\usage{
runGurobi(lpobj, solver.options = list(outputflag = 0))
}
\arguments{
\item{lpobj}{list of matrices and vectors defining the linear
programming problem.}

\item{solver.options}{list, each item of the list should
correspond to an option specific to the LP solver selected.}
}
\value{
a list of the output from Gurobi. This includes the
    objective value, the solution vector, and the optimization
    status (status of \code{1} indicates successful optimization) .
}
\description{
This function solves the LP problem using the Gurobi package. The
object generated by \code{\link{lpSetup}} is compatible with the
\code{gurobi} function. See \code{\link{runCplexAPI}} for
additional error code labels.
